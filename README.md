FFT Implementation in C 

This repository contains implementation of Cooley-Tukey radix-2 decimation-in-time FFT algorithm. The current implementation includes:
* A naive iterative FFT implementation for N=1024 
* An optimized version using Look-Up Tables (LUT) 
* Plans for future optimizations and extensions
